# Simple-Script
SimpleScript is a simple compiled scripting language that runs on a vm.
SimpleScript has no objects or structs, instead opting to use just primitives, tuples, and arrays.

[Prototype Repo](https://github.com/harmless-tech/Simple-Script-Prototype)

### Goals
- Only primitive data types and arrays.
- No structs or objects.
- Compile to a data structure that the runtime (vm) can run.
- Ability to include other files.
- Java-ish like syntax.
- Allow for easy integration of the vm into other programs.
- Minimal dependencies for the compiler and runtime.
- Safety through the use of a compiler, and the ban on null values.
- Security and safety of the vm/runtime. (All vars should be has private and final has possible)
- Allow a heap to hold custom data structures, that will have a long pointer to them. (Part of native extensions)

### Partial TODO
- Currently working on the prototype.

### Running the code
